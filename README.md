# LANDING-PAGE

This was one of my initial self-made things 
Although I know it's not really that great , but still it's a learning step.
I made a very simple website for skechers.
Made a navbar which consisted of a logo, search-box , search-button and listed anchor tags , and arranged all of them horizontally using flex properties.
Also , I made a content section which contains the skechers which have been trending lately.
At last I made a simple footer.
